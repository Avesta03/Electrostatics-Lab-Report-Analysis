This is my undergraduate summative lab report for my year 1 undergraduate physics degree at Durham University.

## The Code

I independently developed a solid framework for sorting and analysing my data (measuring electric force, distance, as well as some additional columns of data that I ended up omitting from the report due to their irrelevance). 

Instead of extracting from an Excel spreadsheet, I extracted from a dedicated CSV file for simplicity.  

I then represented the data in the form of an innovative graph - instead of using traditional error bars, I sought to express them more vividly and demonstrate the range of errors/uncertainties in a more unique way. Note how the error bars now extrapolated across the plot as opposed to existing point-per-point. 

This makes data analysis much more straightforward, as instead of relying on 10 or so bars to conduct further analyses, you can use the developed extrapolation.

### Libraries

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (importing pyplot)

## The Florence Nightingale Graphical Excellence Award

I am one of the few, if not the only, year 1 student this year, to use Python. Most students used Excel or LaTeX - and whilst Python is one of my strongest skills, I realised that the best way of winning this award would be to use Python - there's so much more freedom and potential, unlike pre-set graphs in more commonly used software.

{This section will be updated accordingly in case I win.}
